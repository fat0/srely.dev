# Project Instructions

## Secrets and Credentials Policy

  **NEVER commit secrets, API keys, passwords, tokens, or credentials to this repo.**

  - Before staging files, check for hardcoded secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords, connection strings)
  - If you detect a secret about to be committed: **STOP, warn the user, and ask before proceeding**
  - Use environment variables or local-only config files for secrets (e.g., `.claude/projects/.../settings.local.json`)
  - The `.gitignore` already excludes `.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.keystore`, `key.properties`, and credential files
  - If a new secret-bearing file type is introduced, add it to `.gitignore` before committing

  If the user pastes a secret in the conversation, warn them immediately and recommend rotating it.

## Git Workflow

  **`main` is protected. Never push directly to main.**

  - Create a feature branch for all work (e.g., `feat/hijri-calendar`, `fix/asr-cache`)
  - Commit to the feature branch
  - Submit a PR to merge into main
  - Wait for user approval before merging
  - **Never add `Co-Authored-By` lines to commit messages**
